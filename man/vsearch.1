.SH DESCRIPTION
Environmental or clinical molecular diversity studies generate large
volumes of amplicons (e.g.; SSU-rRNA sequences) that need to be
checked for chimeras, dereplicated, masked, sorted, searched,
clustered or compared to reference sequences. The aim of \fBvsearch\fR
is to offer a all-in-one open source tool to perform these tasks,
using optimized algorithm implementations and harvesting the full
potential of modern computers, thus providing fast and accurate data
processing.
.PP
Comparing nucleotide sequences is at the core of \fBvsearch\fR. To
speed up comparisons, \fBvsearch\fR implements an extremely fast
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, making use of the Streaming SIMD
Extensions (SSE2) of post-2003 x86-64 CPUs. If SSE2 instructions are
not available, \fBvsearch\fR exits with an error message. Memory usage
increases rapidly with sequence length: for example comparing two
sequences of length 1 kb requires 8 MB of memory per thread, and
comparing two 10 kb sequences requires 800 MB of memory per
thread. For comparisons involving sequences with a length product
greater than 25 million (for example two sequences of length 5 kb),
\fBvsearch\fR uses a slower alignment method described by Hirschberg
(1975) and Myers and Miller (1988), with much smaller memory
requirements.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Input
\fBvsearch\fR accept as input fasta or fastq files containing one or
several nucleotidic entries. In fasta files, each nucleotidic entry is
made of a header and a sequence. The header is defined as the string
comprised between the '>' symbol and the first space, tab or the end
of the line, whichever comes first. Additionally, if the header
matches
'>[;]size=\fIinteger\fR;label', '>label;size=\fIinteger\fR;label' or
'>label;size=\fIinteger\fR[;]', \fBvsearch\fR interpret
\fIinteger\fR as the number of occurrences (or abundance) of the
sequence in the study. That abundance information is used or created
during chimera detection, clustering, dereplication, sorting and
searching.
.PP
The sequence is defined as a string of IUPAC symbols
(ACGTURYSWKMDBHVN), starting after the end of the identifier line and
ending before the next identifier line, or the file end. \fBvsearch\fR
silently ignores ascii characters 9 to 13, and exits with an error
message if ascii characters 0 to 8, 14 to 31, '.' or '-' are
present. All other ascii or non-ascii characters are stripped and
complained about in a non-blocking warning message.
.PP
In fastq files, each entry is made of sequence header starting with a
symbol '@', a nucleotidic sequence (same rules as for fasta
sequences), a quality header starting with a symbol '+' and a string
of ASCII characters (offset 33 or 64), each one encoding the quality
value of the corresponding position in the nucleotidic sequence.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR operations are case insensitive, except when soft
masking is activated. Masking is automatically applied during chimera
detection, clustering, masking, pairwise alignment and searching. Soft
masking is specified with the options '\-\-dbmask soft' (for searching
and chimera detection with a reference) or '\-\-qmask soft' (for
searching, \fIde novo\fR chimera detection, clustering and
masking). When using soft masking, lower case letters indicate masked
symbols, while upper case letters indicate regular symbols. Masked
symbols are never included in the unique index words used for sequence
comparisons, otherwise they are treated as normal symbols.
.PP
When comparing sequences during chimera detection, dereplication,
searching and clustering, T and U are considered identical, regardless
of their case. If two symbols are not identical, their alignment
result in a negative mismatch score (default -4), except if one or
both of the symbols are ambiguous (RYSWKMDBHVN) in which case the
score is zero. Alignment of two identical ambiguous symbols (for
example, R vs R) also receives a score of zero.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR can read data from standard files and write to standard
files, but it can also read from pipes and write to pipes! For
example, multiple fasta files can be piped into vsearch for
dereplication. To do so, file names can be replaced with:
.RS
.IP - 2
the symbol '-', representing '/dev/stdin' for input files
or '/dev/stdout' for output files,
.IP -
a named pipe created with the command mkfifo,
.IP -
a process substitution '<(command)' as input or '>(command)' as output.
.RE
\fBvsearch\fR can automatically read compressed gzip or bzip2 files if
the appropriate libraries are present during the
compilation. \fBvsearch\fR can also read pipes streaming compressed
gzip or bzip2 data if the options \-\-gzip_decompress or
\-\-bzip2_decompress are selected. When reading from a pipe, the
progress indicator is not updated.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Options
\fBvsearch\fR recognizes a large number of command-line options. For
easier navigation, options are grouped below by theme (chimera
detection, clustering, dereplication and rereplication, FASTA/FASTQ
file processing, masking, pairwise alignment, searching, shuffling,
sorting, and subsampling). We start with the general options that
apply to all themes. Options may start with a single (\-) or double
dash (\-\-). Option names may be shortened as long as they are not
ambiguous (e.g. \-\-derep_f).
.PP
General options:
.RS
.TP 9
.B \-\-bzip2_decompress
When reading from a pipe streaming bzip2-compressed data, decompress
the data. That option is not needed when reading from a standard
bzip2-compressed file.
.TP
.BI \-\-fasta_width\~ "positive integer"
Fasta files produced by \fBvsearch\fR are wrapped (sequences are
written on lines of \fIinteger\fR nucleotides, 80 by default). Set
that value to zero to eliminate the wrapping.
.TP
.B \-\-gzip_decompress
When reading from a pipe streaming gzip-compressed data, decompress
the data. That option is not needed when reading from a standard
gzip-compressed file.
.TP
.B \-\-help | \-h
Display help text and exit.
.TP
.BI \-\-log \0filename
Write messages to the specified log file. Information written includes
program version, amount of memory available, number of cores and
command line options, and if need be, informational messages, warnings
and fatal errors. The start and finish times are also recorded as well
as the elapsed time and the maximum amount of memory consumed. The
different \fBvsearch\fB commands can also write additional
informations to the log file.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxseqlength\~ "positive integer"
All \fBvsearch\fR operations discard sequences of length equal or
greater than \fIinteger\fR (50,000 nucleotides by default).
.TP
.BI \-\-minseqlength\~ "positive integer"
All \fBvsearch\fR operations discard sequences of length smaller than
\fIinteger\fR: 1 nucleotide by default for sorting or shuffling, 32
nucleotides for clustering, dereplication or searching.
.TP
.B \-\-notrunclabels
Do not truncate sequence labels at first space or tab, use the full
header in output files.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
Suppress all messages to stdout and stderr except for warnings and
fatal error messages.
.TP
.BI \-\-threads\~ "positive integer"
Number of computation threads to use (1 to 256). The number of threads
should be lesser or equal to the number of available CPU cores. The
default is to use all available resources and to launch one thread per
logical core. The following commands are multi-threaded: uchime_ref,
cluster_fast, cluster_size, cluster_smallmem, fastq_mergepairs,
maskfasta, allpairs_global, usearch_global. Only one thread is used
for the other commands.

Chimera detection options:
.PP
.RS
Chimera detection is based on a scoring function controlled by five
options (\-\-dn, \-\-mindiffs, \-\-mindiv, \-\-minh,
\-\-xn). Sequences are first sorted by decreasing abundance ,if
available, and compared on their \fIplus\fR strand only (case
insensitive).
.PP
Input sequences are masked as specified with the \-\-qmask and
\-\-hardmask options. Masking of the database for reference based
chimera detection is specified with the \-\-dbmask option.
.PP
In \fIde novo\fR mode, input fasta file should present abundance
annotations (i.e. a pattern [;]size=\fIinteger\fR[;] in the fasta
header). Input order matters for chimera detection, so we recommend to
sort sequences by decreasing abundance (default of
\-\-derep_fulllength command). If your sequence set needs to be
sorted, please see the \-\-sortbysize command in the sorting section.
.PP
.TP 9
.BI \-\-abskew \0real
When using \-\-uchime_denovo, the abundance skew is used to
distinguish in a three-way alignment which sequence is the chimera and
which are the parents. The assumption is that chimeras appear later in
the PCR amplification process and are therefore less abundant than
their parents. The default value is 2.0, which means that the parents
should be at least 2 times more abundant than their chimera. Any
positive value equal or greater than 1.0 can be used.
.TP
.BI \-\-alignwidth\~ "positive integer"
When using \-\-uchimealns, set the width of the three-way alignments
(80 nucleotides by default). Set to zero to eliminate wrapping.
.TP
.BI \-\-borderline \0filename
Output borderline chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta
format.  Borderline chimeric sequences are sequences that have a high
enough score but which are not sufficiently different from their
closest parent.
.TP
.BI \-\-chimeras \0filename
Output chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta format. Output
order may vary when using multiple threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-db \0filename
When using \-\-uchime_ref, detect chimeras using the fasta-formatted
reference sequences contained in \fIfilename\fR. Reference sequences
are assumed to be chimera-free. Chimeras cannot be detected if their
parents, or sufficiently close relatives, are not present in the
database.
.TP
.BI \-\-dn \0real
No vote pseudo-count, corresponding to the parameter \fIn\fR in the
chimera scoring function (default value is 1.4).
.TP
.B \-\-fasta_score
Add the chimera score to the headers in the fasta output files for
chimeras, non-chimeras and borderline sequences, using the format
';uchime_denovo=\fIfloat\fR;'.
.TP
.BI \-\-mindiffs\~ "positive integer"
Minimum number of differences per segment (default value is 3).
.TP
.BI \-\-mindiv \0real
Minimum divergence from closest parent (default value is 0.8).
.TP
.BI \-\-minh \0real
Minimum score (\fIh\fR). Increasing this value tends to reduce the
number of false positives and to decrease sensitivity. Default value
is 0.28, and values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 included are accepted.
.TP
.BI \-\-nonchimeras \0filename
Output non-chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta
format. Output order may vary when using multiple threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-relabel \0string
Relabel sequences using the prefix \fIstring\fR and a ticker (1, 2, 3,
etc.) to construct the new headers. Use \-\-sizeout to conserve the
abundance annotations.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_keep
When relabelling, keep the old identifier in the header after a space.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_md5
Relabel sequences using the MD5 message digest algorithm applied to
each sequence. Former sequence headers are discarded. The sequence is
converted to upper case and each 'U' is replaced by a 'T' before
computation of the digest. The MD5 digest is a cryptographic hash
function designed to minimize the probability that two different
inputs give the same output, even for very similar, but non-identical
inputs. Still, there is a very small, but non-zero, probability that
two different inputs give the same digest (i.e. a collision). MD5
generates a 128-bit (16-byte) digest that is represented by 16
hexadecimal numbers (using 32 symbols among 0123456789abcdef). Use
\-\-sizeout to conserve the abundance annotations.
.\" The probablity of collision for two sequences is 1/2^128
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_sha1
Relabel sequences using the SHA1 message digest algorithm applied to
each sequence. It is similar to the \-\-relabel_md5 option but uses
the SHA1 algorithm instead of the MD5 algorithm. SHA1 generates a
160-bit (20-byte) digest that is represented by 20 hexadecimal numbers
(40 symbols). The probability of a collision (two non-identical
sequences resulting in the same digest) is smaller for the SHA1
algorithm than it is for the MD5 algorithm.
.\" The probablity of collision for two sequences is 1/2^160
.TP
.B \-\-self
When using \-\-uchime_ref, ignore a reference sequence when its label
matches the label of the query sequence (useful to estimate
false-positive rate in reference sequences).
.\" I am not sure the statement above is true.
.TP
.B \-\-selfid
When using \-\-uchime_ref, ignore a reference sequence when its
nucleotide sequence is strictly identical to the nucleotidic sequence
of the query.
.TP
.B \-\-sizeout
When relabelling, add abundance annotations to fasta headers (using
the format ';size=\fIinteger\fR;').
.TP
.BI \-\-uchime_denovo \0filename
Detect chimeras present in the fasta-formatted \fIfilename\fR, without
external references (i.e. \fIde novo\fR). Automatically sort the
sequences in \fIfilename\fR by decreasing abundance beforehand (see
the sorting section for details). Multithreading is not supported.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchime_ref \0filename
Detect chimeras present in the fasta-formatted \fIfilename\fR by
comparing them with reference sequences (option
\-\-db). Multithreading is supported.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchimealns \0filename
Write the three-way global alignments (parentA, parentB, chimera) to
\fIfilename\fR using a human-readable format. Use \-\-alignwidth to
modify alignment length. Output order may vary when using multiple
threads. All sequences are converted to upper case before
alignment. Lower case letters indicate disagreement in the alignment.
.TP

\-\-fastq_chars command can be used to analyse FASTQ files to identify
the quality encoding and the range of quality score values used. To
convert between different FASTQ file variants, use the
\-\-fastq_convert command. Statistical analysis of the quality and
length of the sequences in a FASTQ file may be performed with the
\-\-fastq_stats and \-\-fastq_eestats commands. Sequences may be
shortened, filtered and converted by the \-\-fastq_filter or
\-\-fastx_filter commands. Paired-end reads can be merged using the
\-\-fastq_mergepairs command. Finally, the \-\-fastx_revcomp command
reverse-complements sequences.

.B \-\-fastq_allowmergestagger
When using \-\-fastq_mergepairs, allow to merge staggered read
pairs. Staggered pairs are pairs where the 3' end of the reverse read
has an overhang to the left of the 5' end of the forward read. This
situation can occur when a very short fragment is sequenced. The 3'
overhang of the reverse read is not included in the merged
sequence. The opposite option is the \-\-fastq_nostagger option. The
default is to discard staggered pairs.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_ascii\~ "positive integer"
Define the ASCII character number used as the basis for the FASTQ
quality score. The default is 33, which is used by the Sanger /

.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_chars \0filename
Summarize the composition of sequence and quality strings contained in
the input FASTQ file. For each of the four DNA letters,
\-\-fastq_chars gives the number of occurrences of the letter, its
relative frequency and the length of the longest run of that
letter. For each character present in the quality strings,
\-\-fastq_chars gives the ASCII value of the character, its relative
frequency, and the number of times a \fIk\fR-mer of that character
appears at the end of quality strings. The length of the \fIk\fR-mer
can be set using \-\-fastq_tail (4 by default). The command
\-\-fastq_chars tries to automatically detect the quality encoding
(Solexa, Illumina 1.3+, Illumina 1.5+ or Illumina 1.8+/Sanger) by
analyzing the range of observed quality score values. In case of
success, \-\-fastq_chars suggests values for the \-\-fastq_ascii (33

other commands that require a FASTQ input file.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_convert \0filename
Convert between the different variants of the FASTQ file format. The
quality encoding of the input file must be specified with the

corresponds to the position in the reads (Pos). The second and third
columns correspond to the number of reads (Reads) and percentage of
reads (PctRecs) that include this position. The remaining columns
include information about the distribution of quality scores in this
position (Q), error probabilities in this position (Pe), and finally
the expected number of accumulated errors from the beginning of the
reads and until the current position (EE). For each of the Q, Pe and
EE distributions, the following statistics are included: minimum value
(Min), lower quartile (Low), median (Med), mean (Mean), upper quartile

\-\-fastaout_notmerged_rev, \-\-fastqout_notmerged_fwd and
\-\-fastqout_notmerged_rev options. Statistics may be output to the
file specified with the \-\-eetabbedout option. Sequences are
truncated as specified with the \-\-fastq_truncqual option to remove
low-quality bases in the 3' end. Sequences shorter than specified with
\-\-fastq_minlen (after truncation) are discarded (1 by
default). Sequences with too many ambiguous bases (N's), as specified
with the \-\-fastq_maxns are also discarded (no limit by
default). Staggered reads are not merged unless the
\-\-fastq_allowmergestagger option is specified. The minimum length of
the overlap region between the reads may be specified with the
\-\-minovlen option (default 10), and the overlap region may not
include more mismatches than specified with the \-\-maxdiffs option (5
by default), otherwise the read pair is discarded. The mimimum and
maximum length of the merged sequence may be specified with the
\-\-fastq_minmergelen and \-\-fastq_maxmergelen options,
respectively. Other relevant options are: \-\-fastq_ascii,

(cluster_fast, cluster_smallmem, cluster_size), masking (maskfasta,
fastx_mask), pairwise alignment (allpairs_global) and searching
(search_exact, usearch_global).

Masking is usually specified with the \-\-qmask option, while the
\-\-dbmask option is used for the database sequences specified with
the \-\-db option with the \-\-usearch_global, 
\-\-search_exact and \-\-uchime_ref commands.

The argument to the \-\-qmask and \-\-dbmask option may be none, soft
or dust. If the argument is none, the no masking is performed. If the
argument is soft the lower case symbols are masked. Finally, if the
argument is dust, the sequence is masked using the DUST algorithm by
Tatusov and Lipman to mask low-complexity regions.

If the \-\-hardmask option is specified, all masked regions are
converted to N's, otherwise masked regions are indicated by lower case
letters.

If any sequence is masked, the masked version of the sequence (with
lower case letters or N's) is used in all output files. Otherwise the
sequence is unmodified. The exception is the sequences in the output
file specified with the \-\-uchimealns option, where the input
sequences are converted to upper case first and lower case letters
indicate disagreement between the aligned sequences.

When a sequence region is masked, words in the region are not included
in the indices used in the heuristic search algorithm. In all other
aspects, the region is treated as other regions.

Regions in sequences that are hardmasked (with N's) have a zero
alignment score and do not contribute to an alignment.

Here are the results of combined masking options \-\-qmask (or
\-\-dbmask for database sequences) and \-\-hardmask, assuming each
input sequence contains both lower and uppercase nucleotides:

.TP
.BI \-\-gapext \0string
Set penalties for a gap extension. See \-\-gapopen for a complete
description of the penalty declaration system. The default is to
initialize the six gap extending penalties using a penalty of 2 for
extending internal gaps and a penalty of 1 for extending terminal
gaps, in both query and target sequences (i.e. 2I/1E).
.TP
.BI \-\-gapopen \0string
Set penalties for a gap opening. A gap opening can occur in six
different contexts: in the query (Q) or in the target (T) sequence, at
the left (L) or right (R) extremity of the sequence, or inside the
sequence (I). Sequence symbols (Q and T) can be combined with location
symbols (L, I, and R), and numerical values to declare penalties for
all possible contexts: aQL/bQI/cQR/dTL/eTI/fTR, where abcdef are zero
or positive integers, and "/" is used as a separator.
.br
To simplify declarations, the location symbols (L, I, and R) can be
combined, the symbol (E) can be used to treat both extremities (L and
R) equally, and the symbols Q and T can be omitted to treat query and
target sequences equally. For instance, the default is to declare a
penalty of 20 for opening internal gaps and a penalty of 2 for opening
terminal gaps (left or right), in both query and target sequences
(i.e. 20I/2E). If only a numerical value is given, without any
sequence or location symbol, then the penalty applies to all gap
openings. To forbid gap-opening, an infinite penalty value can be
declared with the symbol "*". To use \fBvsearch\fR as a semi-global
aligner, a null-penalty can be applied to the left (L) or right (R)
gaps.
.br
\fBvsearch\fR always initializes the six gap opening
penalties using the default parameters (20I/2E). The user is then free
to declare only the values he/she wants to modify. The \fIstring\fR is
scanned from left to right, accepted symbols are (0123456789/LIREQT*),
and later values override previous values.
.br
Please note that \fBvsearch\fR, in contrast to usearch, only allows
integer gap penalties. Because the lowest gap penalties are 0.5 by
default in usearch, all default scores and gap penalties in
\fBvsearch\fR have been doubled to maintain equivalent penalties and
to produce identical alignments.

.TP
.BI \-\-id \0real
Reject the sequence match if the pairwise identity is lower than
\fIreal\fR (value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 included). The search
process sorts target sequences by decreasing number of \fIk\fR-mers
they have in common with the query sequence, using that information as
a proxy for sequence similarity. That efficient pre-filtering also
prevents pairwise alignments with weakly matching targets, as there
needs to be at least 6 shared \fIk\fR-mers to start the pairwise
alignment, and at least one out of every 16 \fIk\fR-mers from the
query needs to match the target. Consequently, using values lower than
\-\-id 0.5 is not likely to capture more weakly matching targets. The
pairwise identity is by default defined as the number of (matching
columns) / (alignment length - terminal gaps). That definition can be
modified by \-\-iddef.

.BI \-\-maxaccepts\~ "positive integer"
Maximum number of hits to accept before stopping the search. The
default value is 1. This option works in pair with \-\-maxrejects. The
search process sorts target sequences by decreasing number of
\fIk\fR-mers they have in common with the query sequence, using that
information as a proxy for sequence similarity. After pairwise
alignments, if the first target sequence passes the acceptation
criteria, it is accepted as best hit and the search process stops for

decreasing number of \fIk\fR-mers they have in common with the query
sequence, using that information as a proxy for sequence
similarity. After pairwise alignments, if none of the first 32
examined target sequences pass the acceptation criteria, the search
process stops for that query (no hit). If \-\-maxrejects is set to a

for weak similarities, but can increase precision. On the other hand,
shorter words may increase sensitivity or recall, but may reduce
precision. Computation time generally increases with shorter words and
decreases with longer words, but it increases again for very long

converted to upper case and U is replaced by T before the digest is
computed. The MD5 digest is a cryptographic hash function designed to
minimize the probability that two different inputs gives the same
output, even for very similar, but non-identical inputs. Still, there
is always a very small, but non-zero probability that two different
inputs give the same result. The MD5 digest generates a 128-bit
(16-byte) digest that is represented by 16 hexadecimal numbers (using
32 symbols among 0123456789abcdef). Use \-\-sizeout to conserve the
abundance annotations.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_sha1
Relabel sequences using the SHA1 message digest algorithm applied to
each sequence. It is similar to the \-\-relabel_md5 option but uses
the SHA1 algorithm instead of the MD5 algorithm. The SHA1 digest
generates a 160-bit (20-byte) result that is represented by 20
hexadecimal numbers (40 symbols). The probability of a collision (two
non-identical sequences having the same digest) is smaller for the
SHA1 algorithm than it is for the MD5 algorithm. Use \-\-sizeout to
conserve the abundance annotations.
.TP
.B \-\-sizeout

Sorting options:
.RS
Fasta entries are sorted by decreasing abundance (\-\-sortbysize) or
sequence length (\-\-sortbylength). To obtain a stable sorting order,
ties are sorted by decreasing abundance and label increasing
alpha-numerical order (\-\-sortbylength), or just by label increasing
alpha-numerical order (\-\-sortbysize). Label sorting assumes that all
sequences have unique labels. The same applies to the automatic
sorting performed during chimera checking (\-\-uchime_denovo),
dereplication (\-\-derep_fulllength), and clustering (\-\-cluster_fast
and \-\-cluster_size).

Subsampling options:
.RS
Subsampling randomly extracts a certain number or a certain percentage
of the sequences in the input file. If the \-\-sizein option is in
effect, the abundances of the input sequences is taken into account
and the sampling is performed as if the input sequences were
rereplicated, subsampled and dereplicated before being written to the
output file. The extraction is performed as a random sampling with a
uniform distribution among the input sequences and is performed
without replacement. The input file is specified with
\-\-fastx_subsample option, the output files are specified with the
\-\-fastaout and \-\-fastqout options and the amount of sequences to
be sampled is specified with the \-\-sample_pct or \-\-sample_size
options. The sequences not sampled may be written to files specified
with the options \-\-fasta_discarded and \-\-fastq_discarded. The
\-\-fastq_ascii, \-\-fastq_qmin and \-\-fastq_qmax options are also
available.

.SH DELIBERATE CHANGES
If you are a usearch user, our objective is to make you feel at
home. That's why \fBvsearch\fR was designed to behave like usearch, to
some extent. Like any complex software, usearch is not free from
quirks and inconsistencies. We decided not to reproduce some of them,
and for complete transparency, to document here the deliberate changes
we made.
.PP
During a search with usearch, when using the options \-\-blast6out and
\-\-output_no_hits, for queries with no match the number of fields
reported is 13, where it should be 12. This is corrected in
\fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
The field raw of the \-\-userfields option is not informative in
usearch. This is corrected in \fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
The fields qlo, qhi, tlo, thi now have counterparts (qilo, qihi, tilo,
tihi) reporting alignment coordinates ignoring terminal gaps.
.PP
In usearch, when using the option \-\-output_no_hits, queries that
receive no match are reported in \-\-blast6out file, but not in the
alignment output file. This is corrected in \fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR introduces a new \-\-cluster_size command that sorts
sequences by decreasing abundance before clustering.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR reintroduces \-\-iddef alternative pairwise identity
definitions that were removed from usearch.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR extends the \-\-topn option to sorting commands.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR extends the \-\-sizein option to dereplication
(\-\-derep_fulllength) and clustering (\-\-cluster_fast).
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR treats T and U as identical nucleotides during
dereplication.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR sorting is stabilized by using sequence abundances or
sequences labels as secondary or tertiary keys.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR by default uses the DUST algorithm for masking
low-complexity regions. Masking behavior is also slightly changed to
be more consistent.

Fix subtle bug in SIMD alignment code that reduced accuracy.
.TP
.BR v1.4.7\~ "released October 7th, 2015"
Fixes a problem with searching for or clustering sequences with
repeats. In this new version, vsearch looks at all words occurring at
least once in the sequences in the initial step. Previously only words
occurring exactly once were considered. In addition, vsearch now
requires at least 10 words to be shared by the sequences, previously
only 6 were required. If the query contains less than 10 words, all
words must be present for a match. This change seems to lead to
slightly reduced recall, but somewhat increased precision, ending up
with slightly improved overall accuracy.
.TP
.BR v1.5.0\~ "released October 7th, 2015"
This version introduces the new option \-\-minwordmatches that allows
the user to specify the minimum number of matching unique words before

Fixed bug in aligned sequences produced with \-\-fastapairs and
\-\-userout (qrow, trow) options.
.TP
.BR v1.9.7\~ "released January 12th, 2016"
Masking behavior is changed somewhat to keep the letter case of the
input sequences unchanged when no masking is performed. Masking is now
performed also during chimera detection. Documentation updated.
.TP
.BR v1.9.8\~ "released January 22nd, 2016"
Fixed bug causing segfault when chimera detection is performed on
extremely short sequences.
.TP
.BR v1.9.9\~ "released January 22nd, 2016"
Adjusted default minimum number of word matches during searches for
improved performance.

some defaults. Removed progress indicator when stderr is not a
terminal. Added \-\-fasta_score option to report chimera scores in
FASTA files. Added \-\-rereplicate and \-\-fastq_eestats
commands. Fixed typos. Added relabelling to files produced with
\-\-consout and \-\-profile options.
.TP
.BR v1.10.1\~ "released February 23rd, 2016"
Fixed a bug affecting the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command causing FASTQ
headers to be truncated at first space (despite the bug fix release
1.9.0 of November 12th, 2015). Full headers are now included in the
output (no matter if \-\-notrunclabels is in effect or not).
.TP
.BR v1.10.2\~ "released March 18th, 2016"
Fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault when running
\-\-usearch_global with an empty query sequence. Also fixed a bug
causing imperfect alignments to be reported with an alignment string
of "=" in uc output files. Fixed typos in man file. Fixed fasta/fastq
processing code regarding presence or absence of compression library
header files.
.TP
.BR v1.11.1\~ "released April 13th, 2016"
Added strand information in UC file for \-\-derep_fulllength and
\-\-derep_prefix. Added expected errors (ee) to header of FASTA files
specified with \-\-fastaout and \-\-fastaout_discarded when \-\-eeout
or \-\-fastq_eeout option is in effect for fastq_filter and
fastq_mergepairs. The options \-\-eeout and \-\-fastq_eeout are now
equivalent.
.TP
.BR v1.11.2\~ "released June 21st, 2016"
Two bugs were fixed. The first issue was related to the \-\-query_cov
option that used a different coverage definition than the qcov
userfield. The coverage is now defined as the fraction of the whole
query sequence length that is aligned with matching or mismatching
residues in the target. All gaps are ignored. The other issue was
related to the consensus sequences produced during clustering when
only N's were present in some positions. Previously these would be
converted to A's in the consensus. The behaviour is changed so that
N's are produced in the consensus, and it should now be more
compatible with usearch.
.TP
.BR v2.0.0\~ "released June 24th, 2016"
This major new version supports reading from pipes. Two new options
are added: \-\-gzip_decompress and \-\-bzip2_decompress. One of these
options must be specified if reading compressed input from a pipe, but
are not required when reading from ordinary files. The vsearch header
that was previously written to stdout is now written to stderr. This
enables piping of results for further processing. The file name '\-'
now represent standard input (/dev/stdin) or standard output
(/dev/stdout) when reading or writing files, respectively. Code for
reading FASTA and FASTQ files has been refactored.
.TP
.BR v2.0.1\~ "released June 30th, 2016"
Avoid segmentation fault when masking very long sequences.
.TP
.BR v2.0.2\~ "released July 5th, 2016"
