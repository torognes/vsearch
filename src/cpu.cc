    Increment selected elements in an array of 16 bit counters.
    The counters to increment are indicated by 1's in the bitmap.
    
    We read 16 bytes from the bitmap, but use only two bytes (16 bits).
    Convert these 16 bits into 16 bytes with either 0x00 or 0xFF.
    Extend these to 16 words (32 bytes) with either 0x0000 or 0xFFFF.
    Use these values to increment 16 words in an array by subtraction.

    how-to-perform-the-inverse-of-mm256-movemask-epi8-vpmovmskb

    Because the efficient PSHUFB instruction is a SSSE3 instruction
    lacking in many AMD cpus, we provide slightly slower alternative
    SSE2 code.
